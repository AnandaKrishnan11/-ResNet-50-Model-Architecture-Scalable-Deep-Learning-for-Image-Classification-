# -ResNet-50-Model-Architecture-Scalable-Deep-Learning-for-Image-Classification-
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the ResNet-50 architecture, a powerful deep learning model widely used for image classification tasks. ResNet-50, part of the Residual Network family, introduced groundbreaking techniques like skip connections, enabling the training of much deeper networks while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

This implementation is built using Keras, with clear definitions of identity and residual blocks that form the core of the ResNet architecture. Each stage of the model is structured to capture increasingly complex features, with a final global average pooling layer and sigmoid activation for efficient classification.
With this ResNet-50 model, users can:

Experiment with a proven deep neural network architecture,
Understand and customize the structure of identity and residual blocks,
Apply the model to new datasets or transfer learning tasks.
This repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in advanced CNN architectures, image processing, and applications of deep learning in visual tasks.
